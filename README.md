# Flex-Form
A minimal form layout framework based on the css grid and flexbox for projects with little to no styles on basic form elements. 
Flex form utilizes a 16 column wide grid for building common fields. Current field configurations include, regular (overhead) fields, inline fields, custom-width fields, button fields, checkbox fields, and date fields (in the case of the jquery datepicker).

## Browser Support
Flex Form does not currently support Internet Explorer or Edge, though future support may be added.
- Feel free to submit a pull request adding support for Internet Explorer or Edge
