# Flex-Form
Flex Form provides the ability to layout forms a lot simpler and with ease. This mini-framework utilizes the css grid and css flexbox to layout a 16 column wide grid for building common fields. Current field configurations include, regular (overhead) fields, inline fields, custom-width fields, button fields, and checkbox fields.

## Browser Support
Flex Form does not currently support Internet Explorer or Edge, though future support may be added.
- Note: Feel free to submit a pull request adding support for Internet Explorer or Edge
