# Arc - A Readable CSS Framework
A minimal css framework that provides styling for projects with little to no styles on basic form elements (as of now). 
Arc inludes arc form which utilizes a 16 column wide grid for building common fields. Current field configurations include, regular (overhead) fields, inline fields, custom-width fields, button fields, checkbox fields, and date fields (in the case of the jQuery datepicker).

## Browser Support
Arc does not currently support Internet Explorer or Edge, though future support may be added.
- Feel free to submit a pull request adding support for Internet Explorer or Edge

## Examples
Examples of what Arc provides can be found in the `example/` folder.
Access to the examples will be simplified in the near future.
